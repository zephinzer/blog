# Text Formatters

- - -

HELLO THERE!

A line of plain text

# header 1 - <h1>
## header 2 - <h2>
### header 3 - <h3>
#### header 4 - <h4>
##### header 5 - <h5>
###### header 6 - <h6>

First up is **Bold**

And this is *Italics*

And now together ***bold and italic***

And this is ~~strikethroughed~~

Lastly it is `code`

[But what if we want a link](#text-formatters)

[Or `code` in **bold** and *italics* ~~in a link~~ (shh)?](#text-formatters)

# Block Formatters

- - -

If `sh` is your cup of tea...

```sh
code "code and more code"

and "then some"

(note the `language-sh` in the class)
```

Otherwise we'd go with JavaScript:


```js
console.info("and then more code");

(note the `language-js` in the class)
```

And...

> This is what a blockquote looks like

>> A double blockquote

>>> A triple blockquote

>>>> A quadraple blockquote

>>>>> I could go on forever

And...

- an
- unordered
  - very
  - messy
    - very
    - unruly
      - very
      - very
        - extremely
        - so
          - long
- list

And...

1. an
1. ordered
    1. very
    1. pleasing
        1. very
        1. neat
    1. listly
1. list

And finally...
